-worst because it just get links to the page which contain the post we are targeting
-it reflect in correct data and it useless to get what we are looking for .

-they best till now because they research across 80 social networks and it can get more than 1000 result per query depending on it
-we can use its api better than google because its reflect real data which we need.
-if we ca pay i think we can contact it because it return what we are targeting .
